```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Sampling

Randomly sample 100 values from a log-normal distribution using mu = 1 and sigma = 0.25:

```{r Sampling}
data <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = .25)
```

## Histogram of sample

Create a histogram of the sampled data:

```{r Hist}
hist(data)
```

Now, create a histogram of the data with a logged scale:

```{r logHist}
log_data <- log(data)
hist(log_data)
```

## Compute mean and variance of sample
```{r MeanVar}
mean(data)
var(data)
```
